# `(r)Evolution of Money`
*(Discovering Money and payment systems of tomorrow)*<br>
Bitcoin rise with crypto industry story

## INTRODUCTION
-- The following text will discuss money systems of the past, current ones in present, but also future perspective and possibilities. In a futuristic context, the first word to mention is **[Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/)**, or short **BTC (₿)**. To explain it, there is a phrase that says: *It's an Answer, and let's see now what the Question is*. For better understanding we need first to grasp the history of money and current monetary systems.
<br>
-- Discussion is lengthy as is the nature of issue, so it's divided into segments for easier understanding.
Do not be discouraged if material seems foreign. Most people depending on level of familiarity with the subject will need to read it several times, since it is abundant with different information. Also best to spread it across multiple days, sleep over it, after which many questions will pop up. For those you have friends and forums to talk with, as well as blogs, articles and podcasts to read/listen. And the more you know the more you want to find out, so called *'Down the Rabbit Hole'*. What is important to get is the idea and concept, and how to aproach it. Not everybody needs to know all technical details in order to use it. But for those how  want to know it deeply some estimate is that minimum 100 hours of active learning is needed to dive into this thing.

## 1. Beginning of trade and money
-- When people switched from hunter-gatherers to agriculture and farming around 10.000 years ago, it led to specialization in work, higher productivity and accumulation of surplus products. This enabled creation of bigger settlements, cities and eventually states. It also meant people could exchange (barter) excess things they got or made, for example grains or animals but it was not easy to determine the value of each item nor to split it. They needed a system which would made trade easier. That's why money was invented and how it came into being.<br>
-- In early days different things were used like special looking seashells, unique stones, later metals and metal coins. If one is wondering why these materials were chosen it's best first to define features of money ([The money Project](http://money.visualcapitalist.com/infographic-the-properties-of-money/)) since it is somewhat an abstract concept:
| № | FUNCTION           | Description                                       |
| - | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Medium of Exchange | accepted method of payment for goods and services |
| 2 | Unit of Account    | measure of value                                  |
| 3 | Store of Value     | to hold value for long period of time             |

Examples of Function:<br>
1-Society uses certain item like pearl to trade for other goods<br>
2-Housing prices in Japan can be compared using Jen as a unit of account<br>
3-An ounce of gold could buy toga in Roman times, yet it can still buy a nice suit today<br>

| № | PROPERTIES    | Description                                                    |
| - | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Durable       | able to withstand repeated use                                 |
| 2 | Divisible     | can divide to smaller units                                    |
| 3 | Portable      | easily carried and transported                                 |
| 4 | Acceptable    | universally recognizable                                       |
| 5 | Limited supply| being rare (scarcity) keeps stable value                       |
| 6 | Uniform       | units capable of mutual substitution, interchangeable [(fungible)](https://mises.org/wire/why-fungibility-important-understanding-money-and-crypto) |

-- Obviously **Gold** had qualities to fulfill most of these roles, but it was not perfect, only best at that time, or so to say the least bad. Some of the disadvantages were not so easy to carry meaning expensive transport - low Portability, hard to Divide (need to melt), and also danger of theft and robbery.<br>
-- Because of that some merchants, later private banks and then central banks started holding gold for people and gave them **certificates** of how much gold they have. People then used those certificates for trade and that's how **paper money** also called **banknotes** or colloquially **cash** came in existence. But bad side was introduction of intermediaries one needs to trust. And history is full of examples were that trust was exploited for all kind of reasons, usually by creating more notes than there was gold to back it. It led to bankruptcy of private banks or hyperinflation by central banks, both resulted in the same outcome, people losing their savings and purchase power.<br>
-- Eventually when most countries seized full monetary control, further development of money came to a halt.<br>

## 2. Recent Historic periods
-- Until 19 century Silver coins were mostly utilized for local Currency, while Gold was used only for high value or international transactions. Definition of **Currency**: Measure in a specific time and place, medium of exchange and legal tender (transfer not taxable) with strong network effect. Around 1870 switch to Gold was made because silver became abundant, and when it's not Rare it can not be good money. That's how the so-called ***'Gold Standard'*** was created in which paper notes were backed by physical gold. That was one of most stable and [prosperous periods](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanlewis/2013/01/03/the-1870-1914-gold-standard-the-most-perfect-one-ever-created/?sh=1d83ebc64a6a).<br>
-- It was temporarily suspended during WW1 when countries, to fund the war efforts, needed to print more money then allowed. Also, there were exceptions from it during the Great Depression. Here to remark that the USA (United States of America) in [1933 seized all gold](https://theconversation.com/how-the-us-government-seized-all-citizens-gold-in-1930s-138467) bullion and coins from its citizens and forced them to sell it below market price.
Again, during WW2 money was overprinted and Gold Standard dropped. Then after WW2, actually in 1944 there was the [Bretton Woods Agreement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp) where 44 allied countries agreed to use **US Dollar (USD - $)** as world's Reserve Currency and for international trading and settlement. Reason it was the US dollar is that the USA was the dominant power at the time, both economically and militarily, which meant it had the greatest influence on the world. It also had biggest reserve of gold, of their own and of allied countries that was shipped there during WW2 for safekeeping.<br>
-- Later the US made a huge budget deficit, caused by excessive domestic spending and by Vietnam war, so the easiest solution was to print more money than there was gold to back it. That finally led to 1971 when the US government with Richard Nixon as president decided to [abandon the Gold Standard](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/aug/15/rise-of-cryptocurrencies-can-be-traced-to-nixon-abandoning-gold-in-1971), meaning dollars were not redeemable for gold from US reserves. After that in 1975 the USA made deal with mayor **Oil** producing countries, [Saudi Arabia deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret) in the first place, that they sell primary energy commodity in US dollars. In return US will give them military protection and also make sure sea routes are safe for tankers, with the help of navy. That's how term **PetroDollars** came, an unofficial system or simply a global practice where dollars were desirable since one could exchange it easily for much needed barrels of petroleum. Some would say dollars were backed by crude oil, most important resource of 20th century.<br>

### Modern age
-- In the modern age money has become more digital, essentially just numbers in computers of private and central banks, as well as in **World bank** and **IMF** (*International Monetary Fund*). First thing is that <ins>today money is created as **Debt**</ins> (*[Credit theory of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_theory_of_money) - Credit creation*). Essentially whenever someone gets a loan from the bank for a car or house or whatever, the bank just types that amount into a computer and new money is created while the entire money supply increases. Still when the debt is repaid that money gets destroyed or in the sense deleted.<br>
-- So in theory this could be stable, in a way that the economic output of a country is mapped to credit demand while Money Supply gets balanced the right way. However, in practice it is never like this, instead artificial push of loans, money markets, government agendas make it unstable and prone to corruption and crises with only solution always to inflate/increase the money supply. Temptation to print is just irresistible.
**Examples of Crises:**
- The Recent event that triggered an overprint was the <ins>Economic Crisis of 2008</ins> which was partly created by banks who gave too much risky credits for real estate backed only by mortgages. And when it all collapsed the government just printed more money to cover it. Excuse was that letting all those banks fail would collapse entire economy both the US and the rest of the world. But still all people paid for the bank misbehavior while managers of those banks at the same time got huge bonuses.<br>
-There are some interesting movies about this subject and link with Wall Street such as: [The Big Short](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/) and [Margin Call](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1615147/). It explains Derivatives like **[CDO](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/collateralized-debt-obligation-cdo/)** (*Collateralized Debt Obligation*) and [Synthetic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/syntheticcdo.asp) ones, complex structured finance product, with subprime mortgage bonds that were used for betting.
- Another even bigger example was <ins>Corona pandemic</ins> during 2020/2021 that resulted in printing new additional [40% of all the money](https://techstartups.com/2021/05/22/40-us-dollars-existence-printed-last-12-months-america-repeating-mistake-1921-weimar-germany/) in existance.

-- Almost all money today is [FIAT](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fiat-money), declared by a government decree and not supported by physical commodity. It is determined by authority, made to be legal-tender (taxes are payed with it), and imposed by force (Political -> Policy -> Police). Based on trust that is often betrayed and backed only by promise it is sometimes referred as Fiat Fraud.<br>
-- Some consider Money printing ([*'fiat mining'*](https://bitcoinfoqus.com/fiat-mining/)) to be [**UBI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income) (*Universal Basic Income*) for the rich. Since new money is usually first available for people close to those in power and to ones that already have it as they can take big credits and already own assets other than cash.<br>
-- The way a country can get more money for budget spending is that the Treasury issues Bonds and the **Central Bank** (*CB*), in the US case the **FED** (*Federal Reserve System*), prints that amount of money and buys those bonds. Since today most money is not in the form of paper cash but is digital, creating new money is simply typing digits on the computers of banks that are saved to a database.<br>
-- Also monetary policies are made very complex. Some would argue deliberately in order to obfuscate it and make it less transparent and more obscure so that less people would object to the system itself. One of the printing mechanisms is [**QE-Quantitative Easing**](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/quantitative-easing-qe/), where banks have the right to issue credits, meaning to print money as already explained, based on deposits they have, in ratio 1:10 or even more ([Fractional Reserve Banking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp)). Opposite policy is known as **Quantitative Tightening**.<br>
-- So it is not just central bank that print money but also commercial ones all around the world. Let's now introduce the term **[Eurodollar](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eurodollar.asp)** - Dollar deposits at foreign banks or American banks branches outside of US (mostly in Europe), that are not subject to regulation nor reserve requirements. In this regard it is hard to even know exactly total supply of money in existance ([all-of-the-worlds-money](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020/)).

### To sum it so far
-- Countries have entire control of money, and can inflate it for different reasons with various economic tools. That power is then often misused by political elites and corporations while chasing profits (somewhat greedy), that result in higher or in some cases even hyperinflation. This sort of inflation is practically an additional hidden Tax on population, one could argue theft in a sense, or financial robbery.<br>
(*"Inflation is the one form of taxation that can be imposed without legislation"* - M. Friedman)<br>
-- State Institutions usually measure Inflation as scalar, just 1 number, [CPI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp) (Consumer Price Index) that includes only basket of basic goods. In practice it is actually a vector because not evebody buys, needs, and wants the same things, so essentially index is mostly fake. Besides just surviving in real world people also desire real estete, traveling, stocks, arts, etc. Instead of just few percents according to CPI, true inflation is lately 10% or more.<br>
-- Until recently stock markets were one way to protected from inflation, but that was also just for small minority (only around 10% of people have significant saving in stock). Currently Crypto Coins - digital tokens, BTC more precisely, are seen as another way, and better in certain ways. Also, it is time consuming to follow all information regarding stock markets and regular people can hardly keep up with various financial instrument used by professional investors.<br>
-- Gold was another safe haven, and in the 2000s there were even electronic gold systems, like '[e-gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold)' but they were centralized and eventually banned by the government. That's why BTC is considered to be **Digital Gold** or **Gold 2.0** as it has many good features of Gold but at the same time fixes the bad ones. So Bitcoin was <ins>**a SOLUTION** to problem</ins> how to have **Sound or Hard money** that can not be overprinted and is also practical to use.<br>
-- Another issue is the censorship that governments and banks can enforce. We could observe this happened in some autocratic countries for opposition but also in democratic ones, like Canadian truckers whose bank account were frozen for protesting against pandemic lockdown. **Cryptocurrency** solves this one as well since it can work without intermediary (trustless) and does not require a trusted party (***Money should Not be weaponized, ever!***). Additionally, it allows seamless transactions across borders. With Liberal world view and partly [Libertarian philosophy](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/04/crypto-is-the-libertarian-cheat-code-in-the-final-battle-over-state-coercion/) part of it's mission is **separating money and state**. We shell never have decent money before we take monopoly of it await from goverment (make goverment smaller and people bigger).<br>
-- Management of Money and Interventions by the state in most cases was done the wrong, and even those with good intentions often have bad results:<br>
  &nbsp; (*"The Goverment solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem"* - M. Friedman)<br>
*. Attempt to do good, imperfectly, and often create more damage than good in pursuit of it<br>
*. When pay for it with inflation it Unintentional collapses the currency<br>
*. Mismeasure the extend of monetary policy while underestimate the cost<br>
## 3. How did it all start?
-- With the beginning of the Internet, information sharing via forums and mails also enabled global spread of ideas. Important movement in this regard was *[Crypto-anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-anarchism)* as a political ideology ([ideological origin](https://fee.org/articles/the-ideological-origins-of-bitcoin/)) focusing on protection of privacy, political and economic freedom.<br>
-- ['*The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto*'](https://libinst.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/havel.pdf) was one of the first written papers that articulated this idea, written by [*Timothy C. May*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/authors/timothy-c-may/) in 1988 and shared at a Crypto conference ('*[Arise, you have nothing to lose..](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/may-crypto-manifesto.html)*'). Document introduced the basic principles of crypto-anarchism, encrypted exchanges ensuring total anonymity ([Privacy manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)), absolute freedom of speech, and full freedom to trade. Later in 1992 a specific mail group called **'*Cypherpunks Mailing List*'** was started and by 1994 had around 1000 subscribers. They were considering using cryptography to make digital(virtual) **Decentralized** money.<br>
-- US Inteligence services like NSA (*National Security Agency*) aka Surveilance State, even tried to limit use and export of cryptography tools - [Crypto Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars), that privacy advocates oposed with Free speech rights.<br>
-- Just like there were torrent (data stream) networks for P2P Peer-to-Peer file sharing (music, films e.g. [Napster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster), [BitTorent](https://www.bittorrent.com/)) this was imagined to be a network for digital value. There is also browser for privacy called [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/download/) abbreviation from [The Onion Rooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)).<br>
-- 2 famous economists, both Nobel laureate, even predicted the rise of Bitcoin:<br>
1. [**Friedrich A. Hayek**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek) in his Book *['The Denationalization of Money'*](https://www.sothebys.com/en/articles/the-economist-who-predicted-bitcoin) (1976)* argued for the end of the government’s monopoly on currency, and in one [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYhEDxFwFRU&t=1118s) (first 3 min) in 1984 said:<br>
*"Govs mostly abuse money and have stop its improvement, also Monetary policy has done only harm. We can’t take it violently out of the hands of government. All we can do is by some sly, roundabout way introduce something they can’t stop."*<br>
-He was proponent of [Austrian School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School) of economic thought (more free market, less goverment control).<br>
2. [**Milton Friedman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman) in 1999 [stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2mdYX1nF_Y):<br>
*"Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government. The one thing that's missing, that will soon be developed, is the reliable e-cache"*.<br>

-- Relevant person also to mention here is *Nick Szabo*, a computer engineer, cryptographer and legal scholar (American of Hungarian origin). In 1998 he designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency he called ***'Bit Gold'***. It was never implemented but has been called *"a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture"* since it was one of the earliest attempts at creating a decentralized virtual currency. In the *Bit Gold* structure, a participant would dedicate computer power to solving cryptographic puzzles. He is also credited with pioneering the concept of **Smart Contracts**.
-- Near the end of 2008 an anonymous person under the pseudonym of ***Satoshi Nakamoto*** published a White Paper named: [**BITCOIN: A Peer-To-Peer E-Cache System**](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) he designed. Definition of term **White Paper**: a report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue and presents the issuing body's philosophy on the matter. The Paper itself references several other works written in decades before it, and it was first sent to the cypher mailing list.<br>

-- At the same time domain '[*bitcoin.org*](https://bitcoin.org/)' was registered through '[*anonymousspeech.com*](https://www.businessinsider.com/swiss-software-developer-bitcoin-2014-4)' using a prepaid card that can be bought with cash at any local store so it is untraceable. Decision to use an alias and hide his identity was done in order to be unknown to the government but also probably to keep the network decentralized, meaning there is no single founder. Majority of people involved consider not having a leader to be a feature, not a bug, since the main purpose of the network is to be decentralized.<br>
--In 2009 a post on the P2P foundation forum was written with additional explanation of the system. In the same year an **[Open-Source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source)** implementation of the protocol was made, and source code is currently hosted on **[GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)**, a code repository. These events unfolded just after the 2008 Economic Crisis, which seems to be the trigger. In first/genesis block there is encoded reference to London Times magazine article:<br>
*"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks".*<br>

-- Receiver of the first BTC transaction and early contributor to the network was a computer scientist named *Hal Finney*. He was an American developer who worked for **[PGP](https://www.openpgp.org)** (*Pretty Good Privacy*) - first free implementations of public-private key encryption. He also ran the first cryptographically-based anonymous remailer and was involved with the cypherpunks mailing list. Other cryptographers and programmers whose work was cited in the BTC paper were *Wei Dai* (***[B-money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bmoney.asp)***) and British *Adam Back* (***[Hashcash](http://www.hashcash.org/)***) who today is CEO of **[Blockstream](https://blockstream.com)**. All four of them were part of the cypherpunks community and members of the mail list, but also early contributors to the Bitcoin project.<br>
-- So Satoshi could be any of them or someone else, maybe even more than one person. It might always [remain a mystery](https://academy.bit2me.com/en/quien-ha-creado-bitcoin/) but in the end it doesn't matter, the important thing is the result and the network itself. Initial improvements to the first website were done by *[Martti Malmi](https://academy.bit2me.com/en/who-is-martti-malmi/)*, a [student from Finland](https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/10/8751933/the-shy-college-student-who-helped-build-bitcoin-into-a-global).
In the following years several persons were wrongly suspected or falsely claimed to be Satoshi.<br>
-- Creator of BTC Satoshi made the last post, at the end of 2010, that stated: *There is more work to be done...*. and since then he has not made any known contact. Today we see that the project continued, and it became a world-changing product. In the meanwhile, contributor *Gavin Andresen* became the lead developer till 2014 when *Wladimir van der Laan* from Amsterdam took over.<br>
-- One peculiar note: First real-world Btc transaction was in May of 2010 for two large pizzas that were paid 10 000 BTC (consider current value of those - hundreds of millions $)<br>

| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |

### Last decade
-- Internet evolution lead from pure data and communication to social information and digital value. While companies and their networks/platforms can be censored protocols can not be blocked so easily.


## 4. Technical background
-- From an engineering aspect Bitcoin protocol is a masterpiece software. We could see that the idea has been circulating for some time and several components of it already existed. But nevertheless integrating it all into a functional unity was done ingeniously. Hats down to Satoshi whoever he / she or they be, for the first full implementation of the idea. Also, the timing was just right. Firstly the internet and cryptography was sufficiently developed. Secondly the political and economic situation was fertile as well, inspiration came from revolt.<br>
-- Let's jump to the point:<br>
Bitcoin has a **Ledger** of transactions, which is a list stored in a database that is not centralized in one server but distributed on multiple computers called **Nodes** around the world. Ledger essentially enables reliable spreadsheet with Balances. It's like immutable record that can't be counterfeited. New transactions are on average every 10 minutes grouped into a **Block** 10 MB in size that is added to the ledger. Each block is connected to previous ones by hash code that is not easy to find. That's why this structure is called **Blockchain**, multiple blocks connected in a line.<br>

-- **[Hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)** is a cryptographic function that converts longer text into a relatively unique code of fixed length but reverse can not be done in any practical time. This characteristic is used to do the so-called **Mining**, virtual one of course, a term taken from the gold industry. That work consists of trying an enormous number of combinations to find one where hash begins with several leading zeros 0. All miners are competing to find it and when one does then a new block is finished, synced across the network, and he also gets the reward of a certain amount of newly created coins.<br>
--In the long term based on statistics, every miner should get approximately equal sum, while on the other side they have spent electric power. Based on the number of participants, the algorithm adjusts the difficulty level to keep it always around 10 minutes. It's done in a way that when there are more miners leading to more hash power difficulty increases which makes it harder to find a solution. This process is called **PoW *(Proof Of Work)***, the term is self-explanatory, that consists of defined rules. The **[Nakamoto Consensus](https://medium.com/nakamo-to/nakamoto-consensus-21cd304f96ff)** is a set of rules that verifies the authenticity of a blockchain network. It is using a combination of the proof-of-work [consensus algorithm](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-the-nakamoto-consensus) on a **[BFT](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practical-byzantine-fault-tolerancepbft)** (*Byzantine Fault Tolerance*) peer-to-peer network.<br>
-- Another important thing to mention is **[PKI](https://www.keyfactor.com/resources/what-is-pki)** (*Public Key Infrastructure*), which is used here to sign digital info with a private key so others can confirm the signature using the public key, usually packed into a **Digital Certificate**. It ensures that no one can spend coins not belonging to them if they do not have the code aka private key. PKI is usually using [***RSA* algorithm**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/) which is based on mathematical inability for large number factorization, to effectively find Prime factors. RSA can be used for digital encryption (hidden data) or for digital signature (ensures data integrity, authentication and non-repudiation). Others algorithms include *Diffie-Hellman* and *Elliptic curve*.<br>

-- Combination of these elements makes entire process quite intriguing and at the same time gives several positive consequences:<br>
&nbsp; 1) Prevents double spending - Digital Scarcity for the first time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (original in virtual realm that could not be copied)<br>
&nbsp; 2) Guaranties integrity and security<br>
&nbsp; 3) Gives proper economic incentives to people using and maintaining the network<br>
It also makes good distribution throughout time with descending inflation, since reward generated with mining is halved every 4 years. Maximum number of coins is limited to **[21 million]([https://decrypt.co/34876/why-is-bitcoins-supply-limit-set-to-21-million](https://decrypt.co/34876/why-is-bitcoins-supply-limit-set-to-21-million))** that would be reached in **year 2140** according to estimates. Currently, in 2022 almost 19 million is already created, about 90%. When reward of new coins shrinks, transaction fee will remain for the miners. Some coins in early adoption period were lost due to owners losing key and Satoshi mined almost 1 million coins that were never moved from initial address. One estimate is that owners have misplaced about 20% of all existing tokens, which makes it even more scarce. Some have been wondering why specific amount of 21 million exactly was chosen for max number. The nominal quantity is not that important as long as it is defined and fixed. Reason being it is divisible, currently up to 8 decimals, and 1 BTC have 100 million satoshis as smallest fraction (up to 8 decimal places).<br>

-- Everybody should be aware that bitcoin is not anonymous, instead it is *Pseudo-Anonymous*, meaning transaction is public but it only has owner number. However if someone ever connects that number to a person then it can be tracked. Ways to avoid being tracked are mentioned in paragraphs bellow.<br>
-- Coins can be stored offline in a digital Wallet or on an exchange. Wallet is a password protected application on mobile or computer, with recovery secret code stored at another location in digital manner or written on paper. It enables full **Self Custody**, in accordance with expression: ***Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins!*** One should not be escaping responsibility, so Take custody of your coins.<br>

### Extended explanation of Bitcoin
As a new internet protocol (internet native money) it enables transfer of value over communication channel. You can basically send gold coin like mail, any amount of value to anywhere in the world almost instantly. Without anyone being able to stop it or have control, it is **Censorship Resistant** and nobody can confiscate it.<br>
This is first case where Greed and Altruistic incentives aligns. You can now make most selfish decision and also contribute to greater equality in the world. As such it is very useful technological inovation that enables distributed consensus but can also be looked at from various angles. When trying to fully understand it one need to grasp ***multiple aspects*** (interdisciplinary) of it, including:<br>
&nbsp;1) **Economical** (Monetary policy) - predefined and limited quantity (relatively fixed supply)<br>
&nbsp;2) **Technical** (Networking) - decentralization<br>
&nbsp;3) **Political** - reducing state monetary control<br>
&nbsp;4) **Ideological** - core value,<br>
&nbsp;5) **Social**<br>

Just like Government has 3 (traditional) branches,<br>
Bitcoin from architectural point include [The Three Branches of Blockchain Governance](https://medium.com/digitalassetresearch/the-three-branches-of-blockchain-governance-75a29bf98880):
| № | **GOV**     | **BIT**         |
| - | ----------- | --------------- |
| 1 | Executive   | Core Developers |
| 2 | Legislative | Full Nodes      |
| 3 | Judicial    | The Foundation  |

The Rules of Bitcoin:
1. No Confiscation
2. No Censorship
3. No Inflation
4. Anyone can verify rules 1-3

### Looking into the Future
Although it has the power to disrupt conventional monetary system we can look at it more as a transformative technology that will improve it. And only time will unlock it's full potential. Firstly it was interesting new technology, and later it became something like investment, sort of digital gold - Store of Value.<br>
In the long run idea is for it to become regular everyday payment service, to fully realize function as Medium of exchange. For this to happen it needs good intergration with second layer lightning protocol for scalability. Once it grows large enough it will become stable which enables it then to be also Unit of Account. If this happens it will inevitable become Global Reserve Asset and in many countries as people adopt it, regulatory will follow to make it like foreign currency, meaning no capital gain tax. Since nobody controls it, it is also easier for all countries, including world super powers, to use to international clearing it since they will not depend on the competition. In that case it's value could rise to few hundred thousands in several years, even reaching a million in 10+ years.<br>

### Other Cryptos
-- When compared to Others crypto coins, important differences are that **BTC** have **First Mover** advantage, so is most known and almost everybody already heard about it. Then it has no leader per se so has higher decentralization and it was **never hacked**. Still this does not mean that other are worthless, many of them have valuable additional features, but it just that they are not the same. Of course there were, are and will be, a lot of those that are more or less scam, so called 'shit'-coins but not all are like that.<br>
BTC is at moment only one that has real change of becoming decentralized global monetary system.<br>
-- There are several reasons why it is main One which includes:<br>
&nbsp;1) True Decentralization - main innovation that only BTC has for real. This is of greatest importance and PoW with all its electricity consumption gives it intrinsic worth rooted in physical world and at same time ensures temporal and spatial security (across time and space)<br>
&nbsp;2) Network effect - the more people use it, it's more likely to become bigger (value increases with number of users)<br>
&nbsp;3) Added value with new uniqe features and functionality<br>
&nbsp;4) Simplistic design in its core and in accordance to IT principle ***[KISS](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/20262/keep-it-simple-stupid-principle-kiss-principle)*** *(Keep IT Simple, Stupid)*<br>
&nbsp;5) Does only one main function in the base - being just money, but does it very good.<br>

-- Some Alt coins could be viewed as startups where buying those is similar to investing in that company, like some DeFi (Decentralized Finance) application that replicate certain bank services and others. With those investemt can often be done wiht **ICO** (*Initial Coin Offer*), analog to **[IPO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp)** (*Initial Public Offer*). It's like Dot-com bubble in the 2000s where there many companies that had web sites but only a few grow to become Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, etc... While many others have completely failed, recent one being Terra-Luna project.<br>
But only BTC is considered (also [by the SEC](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/are-cryptocurrencies-securities-sec-is-answering-question-2022-03-21/)) as **Asset** (other way phrasing it **Digital Property**) while all others cryptos are described as **Securities**.

### Recapitulation
Money systems have changed through history and current one has mayor flaw, it being centralize and having too much power in single place. That inevitable leads to corruption which results in high inflation, so at end we can say it is broken. Reason it was tolerated was that it was the best there was at the time. But with time come new technology that enabled better systems. From the perspective as Store of Value it should have lowest possible inflation. In this regard Bitcoin is in simple words just better money system and overall good if we apply moral framework to it.<br>
-- Hyperinflation and [currency collapses](https://ginifoundation.org/kb/fiat-currency-graveyard-a-history-of-monetary-folly/) are not exceptionally rare events. In fact, the average lifespan of a fiat currency is only about 35 years, which means these events happen much more frequently than many people realize. When view from civilization perspective we want store to last minimum our lifetime, better even longer for inheritance. Also almost half of societal problems arise from money, so fixing the money will fix the world (meme: *Bitcoin Fixes this..*), in part at least. Remaining issue (healt care, ecology, etc) will need their their own solutions. Money should be a **Fiduciary** system (legally and ethically bound to act in clients/users best interest and ahead of their own, duty to preserve good faith and trust).<br>

### What next ?
First its important to learn as much and have wide understanding of it all. Since this system is not forced but is **Opt-In** (freely choose to use it / be involved and make better world) just learning about it is already a contribution, then comes playing with it and later teaching others around you. There is a famous meme (rapidly spread cultural element): **[LaserEyes](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/laser-eyes-crypto)** - significant focus on important thing that can make a difference.<br>
Secondly decide if you want to by some, for now as an investment and later as a Savings Accounts. This way you will try it yourself and learn a few thing. Install one or few of recommended wallets, register on exchange, withdraw funds to your wallet.<br>
Regarding the amount, usually there are few advisable options:<br>
&nbsp;1) buy only what you are ready to lose<br>
&nbsp;2) don not sell in bear market when it falls down, instead Hold or HODL (meme variation)<br>
&nbsp;3) consider to start accepting payments in Bitcoin (try lightning wallet)<br>
